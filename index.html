        <h3>Graphics Designing</h3>
        <p>I developed interest in graphics desiging when at the age of 17 I saw a graphic designer doing some fancy stuff on screen. That fascinated me alot. That day I thought of learing graphics designing using CorelDRAW and after that till date I'm learning in a self pace. In the journey I also completed some small-small designing projects.</p>

        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p>I'm still a learner to this skill as well. However, more than a year age I created and hosted a personal website. That website was created using simple wordpress. Also, in that I was successful enough to get my site indexed on Google, Bing and Yandex. That project gave me motivation to further learn this skill and hence I started from very beginning (i.e. HTML, CSS) and now moving further ahead.</p>
